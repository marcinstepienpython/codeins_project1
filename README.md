# A Website for a band
Milestone project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a website for 1960 rock band. The primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available. Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.

## DEMO
A live demo can be found [here](https://marcinstepienpython.github.io/codeins_project1/)

## UX
The goal of the design was to create a kind of an old-school looking website giving an impression of 1960s. To achieve this 'feeling' I decided to use grey-scale colours and black&white images. As the primary audience  are band's fans I decided to include sections that most fans would be interested in (news, dates of concerts, albums, sample of music and videos, posters). The band is interested in performing at various events. That's why a 'book a show' section is included, where fans may contact the band for possible live shows. My idea was to use 'dynamic and powerful' images that match the music band character and charisma. 

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.0)
4. JavaScript (scroll spy)


## Features
This site uses the scrollSpy feature. The navbar is top-fixed to make the navigation easy.

## Testing

This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Internet Explorer, FireFox, Puffin) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 7/8 and Huawei P8, Samsung Galaxy Tab) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. There was a problem with background-attachement: fixed (iPhone 8) which I improved using media-query and background-attachment: initial.

The navigation were tested both on desktop and mobile devices. The scroll-spy respobsible for highlighting the appropriate menu item workd well and is a great feature to make the navigation easy. 

The test scenarios included:
1. Finding all kind of info on the website (news, concerts dates).
2. Playing sample music on various devices.
3. Playing vido clip provided by the band.
4. Filling up the 'book a show' form.
5. Checking the scroll-spy
6. Chcecking if the social links work properly.


## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named `index.html`.
